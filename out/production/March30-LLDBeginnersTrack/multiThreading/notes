Create task -> Runnable or Callable
task does not return anything : Runnable
task has to return something : Callable

ExecutorService -> maintains the threadpool and
execution of tasks, we dont create any task
inside executorService.

execute a callable task -> executor.submit(task)
execute a runnable task -> executor.execute(task)
